## overview of files for me ##

0_masterFile.R
# reads in RData file and then runs 1,2,3,4 according to preference
# also allow possibility to use already existent csv output from pipeline
#   (folder 4) for the temporal resolution plots -> saves time!!



1_descriptiveStats(Fig1c).R
# mostly just Fig 1c -> can you include d' thing?

2_ANOVAs(Fig2-3).R
# figure output and csv file with results: 2way ANOVAs + posthoc tests
# -> output as is or prettier?

3_GLMMs_binbeforeRT(Fig4-6).R
# only the GLMMs for binbeforeRT
# output as is or prettier?

4_GLMMs_temporalResolution(Fig7).R
# allow possibility to run all GLMM and then R2mplots or
#                      just reading in GLMM csv and then plots
# -> much quicker!
